Examples
===========

- For multiome datasets in which cells are not paired, we use GLUE to integrate these two modalities. A step-by-step workflow can be checked `here <https://github.com/xuyunfan9991/SCRIPro/blob/main/examples/Use_Glue.ipynb>`_.
- For dataset that only have single-cell/spatial RNA-seq data, you can refer to `here <https://github.com/xuyunfan9991/SCRIPro/blob/main/examples/only_rna_workflow.ipynb>`_.
- Using single-cell multiome dataset for pseudo time trajectory, you can refer to `here <https://github.com/xuyunfan9991/SCRIPro/blob/main/examples/Trajectory_workflow.ipynb>`_.
