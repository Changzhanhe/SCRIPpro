Examples
===========

It is very easy to use the SCRIPro, which you only need to write a single command line as mentioned in “Usage” part. Here, we provide 4 examples that applied SCRIPro to diverse biological systems and used the results to analyze more interesting biological findings. We provided custom some analyzing codes here, and detailed methods and conclusions can be found in our paper and  `Github <https://github.com/xuyunfan9991/SCRIPro>`_.

.. - For multiome datasets in which cells are not paired, we use GLUE to integrate these two modalities. A step-by-step workflow can be checked `here <https://github.com/xuyunfan9991/SCRIPro/blob/main/examples/Use_Glue.ipynb>`_.  
.. - For dataset that only have single-cell/spatial RNA-seq data, you can refer to `here <https://github.com/xuyunfan9991/SCRIPro/blob/main/examples/only_rna_workflow.ipynb>`_.  
.. - Using single-cell multiome dataset for pseudo time trajectory, you can refer to `here <https://github.com/xuyunfan9991/SCRIPro/blob/main/examples/Trajectory_workflow.ipynb>`_.
